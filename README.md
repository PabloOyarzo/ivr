# ivr
Command line tool to calculate Ohm's Law values

## Why?
Just to test my bash scripting capabilities.
I thought that calculating Ohm's Law for resistances using Voltage and Current values would be a good start.

## How to use it?
```
mkdir scripts
cd scripts
git clone https://github.com/PabloOyarzo/ivr.git
```
After cloning the repository you can simple use the tool via:
```
cd ivr
bash ivr.sh
```
After doing this the bash will prompt you to input the Current and Voltage you are working with.(The tool only take integers)
After the inputs the tool will return your Resistance Value.
